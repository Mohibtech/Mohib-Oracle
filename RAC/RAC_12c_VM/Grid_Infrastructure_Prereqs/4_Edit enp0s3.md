### Edit enp0s3
Edit `"/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3"` (eth0) file, making the following change. This will take effect after the next restart.

> ONBOOT=no


There is no need to do the restart now. You can just run the following command. Remember to amend the adapter name if yours are named differently.

> ifdown enp0s3  
#ifdown eth0


At this point, the networking for the first node should look something like the following. Notice that enp0s3 (eth0) has no associated IP address because it is disabled.
```
